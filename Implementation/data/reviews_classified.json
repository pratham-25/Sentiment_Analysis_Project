And it lasts. I think a lot of lotions just have too much water in them. It has a very nice, subtle scent. I have to avoid a lot of lotions just because the scent is too strong!\n\nI am overall very \"frugal\" but I think this cream is worth the money.",

    "reviewText": "First off, my metal bottle and the pump arrived totally undamaged and fully functioning (this was something others had complained about).\n\nThe scent is kind of a spicy herb smell.  Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).\n\nI'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.  This is a must have for people whose hands or other parts of the body start to bleed during the winter without constant attention.  I wouldn't recommend it for daily full body application due to the price and thickness, but it's great for targeting problem areas.",

    "reviewText": "I was told by my dad to pick up a trade while I was an undergrad, and that trade was beauty. I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.\n\nSomeone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!\n\nSkip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!\n\nYou cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.\n\nI remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!\n\nThe pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.\n\nMy mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.\n\nAs she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her. We love this stuff, and if it came by the gallon, we'd invest in tubs!",
